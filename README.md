# Traveling Salesman Problem

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. Its goal is to find the shortest possible route that a traveling salesman can take to visit a given set of cities and return to his starting point.\
Project allows to solve TSP using Farthest Insertion algorithm to create initial solution and Tabu Search algorithm to try to find a solution as close to the optimal one as possible.
Program:
- reads .txt files to get data about cities coordinates and correct cities order(data from http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/)
- allows user to execute FI and TS algorithms,
- allows user to plot graphs showing course of routes for optimal solution, initial solution created with FI algorithm and final solution created with TS algorithm,
- print each solution values - total tour distance
